# Spanish Comprehensible Input
*Learn Spanish following DELE proficiency standard.*

Inspired by thaoshibe.github.io's [Chinese version](shibe.github.io/comprehensible-input-chinese/)!

## Features
- TTS for sentences
- Conjugation Charts and gloss for new words
- SRS Vocab Anki-style Learner tab
- Translations
- DELE level markers
- Single HTML File containing all the codes, sentences and modifications

### Todo's
- [ ] Separate out into a JSON Schema to quickly add to
- [ ] Build a Python/JS Script to scrape and build verb and vocab trees to build sentences from
- [ ] Grab all of the DELE A1-C1 concepts and build sentences from examples
- [ ] Confirm setences are in fact legible and idiomatically correct
- [ ] List how much of the content is missing like ThaoShibe's site

### Acknowledgements
- [thaoshibe.github.io](thaoshibe.github.io) for the inspiration as that has been an amazing tool for growing
- Claude for helping me code this up and spiff up my original version
